# Lab_Assignment_2
This project is all about creating a machine learning model for Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnositics prediction.
To begin with, I imported all required libraries like pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, sklearn, and many more.
Afterthat, imported dataset which has 569 rows and 33 columns and did exploratory data analysis on dataset.
Followed by, did data cleaning and preparing to train the model.
Split the dataset and did feature scaling using StandardScaler library which is a part of sklearn and fit the model.
So, in Fenil_Patel_model_v1 file I applied Logistic Regression algorithm achieved accuracy score of 95%.
Finally, in the Fenil_Patel_model_v2 file I applied Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm and got 96% accuracy.
